# Classification of Food Using Deep Learning

This project aims to classify different categories of food using deep learning techniques. It consists of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for image prediction. The GUI allows users to either upload an image or capture one using a camera to predict its food category.

## Abstract
-Food classification is crucial for numerous
applications, including dietary monitoring and image-based
food recognition, aiming to promote healthier eating habits
and facilitate food-related tasks. 
-This abstract presents a comparative analysis of three deep learning models—Inception-
V3, MobileNet, and a custom CNN—for classifying food items.
-Additionally, this study explores the efficacy of InceptionNet
and MobileNet architectures alongside a custom CNN model.
-The motivation behind this research stems from the growing
need for efficient food classification systems to promote healthier
dietary choices and streamline food-related tasks in various
domains. The promising results underscore the potential of our
approach to significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency
of food classification systems, with wide-ranging applications in
dietary monitoring and food recognition. 
-Dataset contains of 17500 images of different categories like pizza, hot dog, waffles etc.

-An InceptionNetV3 version is used in this paper, which
uses optimizer Adam and loss function Categorical Cross
Entropy and batch size is 32 and epochs are 50.
This model gives the accuracy of 88.6% and F1 score of
0.87 and precision of 0.88 and recall of 0.87.

-A MobileNet version is used in this paper, which uses
optimizer SGD and loss function Categorical Cross Entropy and
batch size is 30 and epochs 50.
This model gives the accuracy of 88.4% and F1 score of
0.89 and precision of 0.89 and recall of 0.89.

-A Custom CNN version is used in this paper, which uses
optimizer Adam and loss function Categorical Cross Entropy
and batch size is 30 and epochs 100.
This model gives the accuracy of 78.7% and F1 score of
0.78 and precision of 0.78 and recall of 0.77.

Confusion matrix indicates for all category the false negatives
are zero. And false positives are 2. Total types of categories =20.

## Project Overview

This project involves the following steps:
1. Preprocessing the food images.
2. Training a deep learning model on the preprocessed data.
3. Evaluating the model performance using accuracy and loss curves, classification report, and heatmaps.
4. Predicting the category of a single food image.
5. Implementing a GUI using Tkinter to upload or capture images and predict their categories.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- OpenCV
- PIL
- Tkinter

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-classification.git
   cd food-classification
2. Launch the jupyter notebook

   
## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anishhhhhhhh18/food-101-20-class). Download and extract the dataset into the `data` directory within the project folder.

## Usage

### Preprocessing

Run the preprocessing steps in the Jupyter Notebook to prepare the data for training. This includes resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the dataset into training and validation sets.

### Model Training

Train the deep learning model using the preprocessed data. The model architecture and training process are defined in the notebook.

### Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance by visualizing accuracy and loss curves, generating a classification report, and creating heatmaps to show model predictions.

### Prediction

Predict the category of a single food image. This can be done using an image from the dataset, an online image, or an image captured using a camera.

### GUI

Use the Tkinter-based GUI to upload or capture an image and predict its category. The GUI provides buttons for selecting an image from the file system or capturing one using the camera.

## Results

The results of the model training and evaluation, including accuracy, loss curves, classification report, and heatmaps, are displayed in the Jupyter Notebook. The GUI allows for real-time prediction of food categories.
